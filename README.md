- **Safety Warning**: Alerts you when choosing intervals under 100ms to help prevent bans.

2. **Open the Extension**:
   - Click on the TikTok Live Auto Clicker icon in your browser toolbar.

3. **Select Device Mode**:
   - **Desktop**: Targets the like button on the TikTok Live video.
   - **Mobile**: Clicks the center of the screen, simulating a tap.

4. **Set the Click Count and Interval**:
   - **Number of Clicks**: Enter the total number of clicks you want the extension to perform.
   - **Click Interval (ms)**: Enter the time interval (in milliseconds) between each click.
     - **Warning**: If you set an interval below 100ms, a warning popup will alert you about the potential risk of being banned. You can choose to proceed or adjust the interval.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error Messages**: If you see a warning message stating that the clicker could not start, it may mean the script was not available on the TikTok page. Refresh the page and try again.
- **Using Low Intervals**: Setting an interval under 100ms may lead to temporary bans from TikTok. Please use intervals above 100ms for safe usage.
- **Checking Content Script Load**: Open the Developer Console on the TikTok Live page and check for the message `"TikTok Auto Clicker content script loaded"`. This confirms that the content script is active on the page.

## Disclaimer

Use this extension responsibly and be mindful of TikTokâ€™s terms of service. Excessive auto-clicking or using extremely fast intervals may lead to account restrictions.
